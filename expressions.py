print( 2 + 2 )
# prints the 4 as output

print( 5 - 2 )
# prints the 3 as output

print( 3 * 7 )
#prints the 21 as output

print ( 2 + 3 * 6 )
# gives 20 as output 
# first does the multiplication of 3*6 as 18
# then addition is done of 18+2

print ( (2+3) * 6 )
# gives 30 as output 
# first does the addition of 2+3=5 and 
# then does the multiplication 5*6=30

## print ( 5 + ) writing such expression gives the invalid syntax

# we can concatinate the two multiple strings as expressions of one strings
print ( 'Sujan' + 'Shrestha')
# gives SujanShrestha as output in one string

## string replication

print ('Sujan' * 3)
# gives SujanSujanSujan as output which multiplies the strings 3 times
